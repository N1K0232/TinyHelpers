A collection of helper methods and classes for ASP.NET Core that I use every day. I have packed them in a single library to avoid code duplication.

**Installation**

The library is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TinyHelpers.AspNetCore). Just search for *TinyHelpers.AspNetCore* in the **Package Manager GUI** or run the following command in the **.NET CLI**:

    dotnet add package TinyHelpers.AspNetCore

**Contribute**

> **Warning**
Remember to work on the **develop** branch, don't use the **master** branch directly. Create Pull Requests targeting **develop**.
